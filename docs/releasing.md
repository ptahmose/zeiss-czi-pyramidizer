# Releasing

This document describes the release policy for binary distributions of
`czi-pyramidizer`.

## Release Targets

Binary releases are produced for the same platforms that are built by the
project's continuous integration workflows:

- Windows x64
- Windows ARM64
- Linux x64
- Alpine Linux x64

All release targets should build successfully and run their available tests
before release artifacts are published.

## Release Assets

Each GitHub release should provide one archive per supported platform. The
archive should contain:

- `czi-pyramidizer` or `czi-pyramidizer.exe`
- `LICENSE`
- `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`
- release notes or a release README

The release should also provide:

- an SPDX JSON software bill of materials (SBOM)
- SHA-256 checksums for all release assets
- source and build information sufficient to rebuild the released binaries

## Static Linking

Release binaries are built with static linking where practical. In particular,
`czi-pyramidizer` may statically link `libCZI`.

`libCZI` is a ZEISS library made available as open source software. When a
release uses `libCZI` under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), the
release must preserve the recipient's ability to rebuild or relink
`czi-pyramidizer` with a modified LGPL-covered `libCZI`.

The relinking procedure is documented in
[Static LGPL Relinking](release-lgpl-relinking.md).

## SBOM

Each release should include one SPDX JSON SBOM for the release artifacts. The
SBOM should describe the released binaries and their relevant build-time and
linked components, including `libCZI`, OpenCV, CLI11, GSL, RapidJSON, and other
platform-specific dependencies.

The SBOM should identify exact versions or source revisions where possible.

## Checksums

The release should include a `SHA256SUMS` file with checksums for all published
release assets. Users can use the checksums to verify that downloaded assets
match the files published by the project.

## Release Notes

Release notes should include:

- the released version
- supported platforms
- a summary of notable changes
- known limitations
- a reference to the SBOM and checksums
- a note that static `libCZI` releases can be rebuilt with a modified `libCZI`
  by following the documented relinking instructions
